I have managed to compile and make this library work on Mono, here are the instrucions on how to build it on debian:

Dependancies:

sudo apt install mono-complete mono-devel mono-mcs

take into consideration that the build script was written for bash, anyhow to compile it just run

make mono

you should see a dll file called Mono.Nat.dll
